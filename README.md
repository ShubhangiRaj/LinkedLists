# LinkedLists
What is a linked list?
-----------
A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements. A data element can be represented as a node in a linked list. Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node.
Unlike arrays, data elements are not stored at contiguous locations. The data elements or nodes are linked using pointers, hence called a linked list.

I have written an article on linked list.
